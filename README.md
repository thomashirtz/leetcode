## Dataframe & Git Automation

The python file [[automation.py]](automation.py) provides a simple way to automatise the generation of 'row' and folder/files to update the repository. For example, if the ids is set to [2, 13], the script will generate the files, the missing folders and output:

```
|2|[Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)|[Python](./0000-0100/2-add-two-numbers.py)|Medium|
|13|[Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/)|[Python](./0000-0100/13-roman-to-integer.py)|Easy|
```

The automation file also generate a dataframe that summarize all the existing Leetcode questions:
